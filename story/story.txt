Armageddon 
----------------------
Let’s start with what you already know, In the middle of the cuban missile crisis when the world was inches away from two nuclear superpowers annihilating all of mankind, we had a few saner souls like Vasily Arkhipov, Vasily was posted in a Russian Submarine out in the caribbean mistakenly believed war had already broken out and two of the senior officers gave a go-ahead to fire it’s nuclear torpedo, but Vasily the third senior officer refused to authorize. And thus preventing an all out nuclear armageddon.

But our story takes place in a one of the infinite universerses amongst the ever-expanding cosmos, where Vasily was never born and as such the submarine in the caribbean was under the command of Aleksandr Ivanov born in 1925 right after the Civil War, Aleksandr was a ruthless military general, he lost his left index finger in battle. His father and brothers served in the first and second world wars, He also had a second brother who got arrested, when Stalin was getting rid of everyone who dared oppose him. Aleksandr has a tough childhood, when he was seven his mother divorced his father and began having an affair with an ex-KGB Agent, His mother only took Aleksandr who was the youngest of her three children in retrospect this event can be said as the moment in the life of young Aleksandr who would go on to be one of the key reasons for the cause of WW3, and the end of civilization as we know it.

A few months later a woman was killed a few weeks later near the capital it was never confirmed who the woman was but Aleksandr knew it in his heart his mother was no more with him. All of this was a huge toll on the young boy and at the age of 18 in the year of 1943 joined the Soviet Navy and his lack of empathy proved him to be highly efficient at gathering intel from the American spies which the KGB captured and very soon he was became a name in the offices of KGB, with the support of his new friends he was quick to rise in the ladder of the soviet navy and very soon he was leading the soviet submarine B-59 U.S. B-59 came in contact with the Americans and this is when the Americans learned that the submarine was armed with nuclear torpedoes.

The conditions in the Soviet submarines were so physically difficult and unstable that commanding officers, fearing they were under attack by U.S. forces and the soldiers panicked and in this moment of heat the captains and Aleksandr gave permitted a launch of a nuclear torpedo towards a
