# Binary Executable
-----------------------------

This binary has been compiled only for Fedora Linux 36 (Workstation Edition) x86_64 using gcc (GCC) 12.1.1 20220507 (Red Hat 12.1.1-1)
Some times I use Arch, I always update it before I begin working so guess the version is the day I wrote the code
